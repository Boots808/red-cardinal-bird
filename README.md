Title: Work Day Scheduler Application

Author: Bethany Stankey

Description: Challenge 5 Assignment

Purpose:
The Purpose of this web page is to allow the user to save inputted text tasks in to a Work Day Schedule and be able to easily view the past/present/future time based on the hour column colors

Functionality:
This page has an attached JS file that uses Javascript, JQuery, moment.js,and Bootstrap functions. It has a save feature and column color changing function that is based on the time. 


Note: There are newer resources used in place of moment.js currently, should apply update to this in the future

Note: I could not figure out the function to save on refresh, will need to come back in and add that when time allows. 

Note: Will want to add in mediaQuery to allow for muliple screen sizes such as tablets etc. 

Note: Can easily update the hour parameters by updating the HTML calendar time section
